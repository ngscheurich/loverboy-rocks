## Development

This project is built on [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), my favorite static site generator.
To hack on the source, youâ€™ll need the Gatsby CLI program installed:

```sh
$ npm install --global gatsby-cli
```

You can then `cd` into the project directory and spin up a live-reloading dev server:

```sh
$ gatsby develop
```
